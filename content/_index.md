Hugotenbert is a project to host public domain books published in `plaintext` Gutenberg format. The project is a remix of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) projects.

## What is Hugo

From the project [website](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/):

```
Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking,
Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically
build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you
create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often
than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing
experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience
for website authors.
```

## What is Project Gutenberg

From the project's mission statement by **Michael Hart** from [The Project Guteberg Mission Statement](https://www.gutenberg.org/about/background/mission_statement.html):

```
The mission of Project Gutenberg is simple: To encourage the creation
and distribution of eBooks.

This mission is, as much as possible, to encourage all those who are
interested in making eBooks and helping to give them away.

In fact, Project Gutenberg approves about 99% of all requests from those
who would like to make our eBooks and give them away, within their
various local copyright limitations.

Project Gutenberg is powered by ideas, ideals, and by idealism.

Project Gutenberg is not powered by financial or political power.

Because we are totally powered by volunteers we are hesitant to be very
bossy about what our volunteers should do, or how to do it.

We offer as many freedoms to our volunteers as possible, in choices of
what books to do, what formats to do them in, or any other ideas they may
have concerning “the creation and distribution of eBooks.”

Project Gutenberg is not in the business of establishing standards.
If we were, we would have gladly accepted the request to convert an
exemplary portion of our eBooks into HTML when World Wide Web was a
brand new idea in 1993; we are happy to bring eBooks to our readers
in as many formats as our volunteers wish to make.

In addition, we do not provide standards of accuracy above those as
recommended by institutions such as the U.S. Library of Congress at
the level of 99.95%. While most of our eBooks exceed these standards
and are presented in the most common formats, this is not a
requirement; people are still encouraged to send us eBooks in any
format and at any accuracy level and we will ask for volunteers to
convert them to other formats, and to incrementally correct errors as
times goes on.

Many of our most popular eBooks started out with huge error levels–only
later did they come to the more polished levels seen today. In fact, many
of our eBooks were done totally without any supervision–by people who had
never heard of Project Gutenberg–and only sent to us after the fact.

We want to continue to encourage everyone to send us eBooks, even if they have
already created some without any knowledge of who we were, what we were doing,
or how we were doing it.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Project Gutenberg.

Thus, there are no dues, no membership requirements: and still only the most
general guidelines to making eBooks for Project Gutenberg.

We want to provide as many eBooks in as many formats as possible for the entire
world to read in as many languages as possible.

Thus, we are continually seeking new volunteers, whether to make one single
favorite book available or to make one new language available or to help us
with book after book.

Everyone is welcome here at Project Gutenberg.

Everyone is free to do their own eBooks their own way.

## Hugo + Gutenberg = Hugotenberg

On this site some of the books from Project Gutenberg are hosted as a Hugo site content.
The books are in the public domain and are available online with features such as-

- Responsive design
- Dark mode
- Accessibility features
- Images and illustrations
- Equations and formulas
- Diagrams and tables
- Code and syntax highlighting
- Footnotes and references
- Table of contents
- Search and navigation

Eventually efforts will be made to convert the books in an automated fashion
to the `markdown` format and host them here. For the moment, the books are
being transferred manually to the `content` directory per the Hugo protocol.
